# hsl-fun

Just having some fun with the HSL API. For now the app just allows you to click around the map and showing you the stops within a radius of 500m.

The frontend uses react written in TypeScript.

The backend project which is written with clojure uses leiningen.

To run the application just run the following commands in different terminals:
```bash
make start-backend
make start-frontend
```
